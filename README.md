# fate-react (fate.netlify.app)

- reader-writer-community-platform in development
- early stages
- will be updated frequently on a **private repo**
- note that this is the **public repo** for code reviews, it does not include any credentials necessary to run the app

## prerequisites

- requires installation of node (v18.15.0) and npm (9.5.0)
- utilizes google firebase (auth) and firestore

## frontend

1. npm install
2. sass --watch src/assets/scss/index.scss:src/index.css --style=compressed
3. if I know you and you'd like to try running the app locally, you can get the .env file for google firebase credentials from me
